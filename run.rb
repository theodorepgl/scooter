# DONE Implement methods to transition scooter states (e.g., rent and return) and display current status.
# DONE Scooters can also be marked as "Broken," rendering them temporarily unavailable for rental until repaired.
# DONE Broken scooters should be taken to the garage or repair shop for maintenance and returned to the fleet once repaired. 
# Calculate and present rental duration and associated costs.
# Designate docking stations in specific areas for scooter returns.
# Docking stations possess a predefined scooter capacity.

# (Bonus) A way to keep track of information about the rented scooter, the user renting it, and the start and end times of the rental.
# (Bonus) Introduce a pricing system where rental costs vary based on different times of the day (peak hours vs. off-peak hours). "Seasonal offer example"
